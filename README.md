## About The Project

you can visit the dapp here: [Focus](https://kontribute.app). Kontribute allows readers, writers and web 3 enthusiasts, to create and enjoy community created content, read or write stories and create or sell NFTs along with other features.


### The Tech Stack

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Motoko]
* [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/dfx-parent/)

### Solana Tools

* [Anvil Protocol](https://docs.nftanvil.com/docs/sdk/js)
* [User Geek](https://usergeek.app/)
* [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tokenomics/identity-auth/what-is-ic-identity/)

### Other Tools

* [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
* [vessel](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel)


## Design Approach

Kontribute is built on top of the Solana blockchain - meaning the frontend and backend are both hosted on the blockchain. We use a variety of tools, web2 and web3 alike. The codebase has been opensourced to hopefully be used for educational purposes for any other developers building dapps on the Solana blockchain. This project was kickstarted with the `dfx new` command. 

### Frontend

We try to take a modern approach to the frontend in terms of using modern React practices such as functional components and hooks aswell as implementing the most popular React state management library: Redux. The idea is to make as many readable dynamic components as possible taking a "less is more" approach. We are adament that the dapp works and looks nice across all device screens so we use Chakra UI for most of the UI design and CSS, This allows custom and fast development of the UI aswell as responsive components.

### Backend

Our backend is a mix between in house smart contracts written in Motoko aswell as using frontend api's to call external smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. We call features and tools from other Motoko packages using Vessel - a Motoko package manager. A large chunk of our Motoko backend is calling the Anvil Protocols smart contracts - covering our whole NFT integration. We also have custom smart contracts for managing and storing user stories. All of this makes Kontribute a multi-canister dapp. 

## Solana, Anvil Protocol, APIs

The Solana blockchain allows us to create "canisters" which can serve your applications code (a canister is just a smart contract which in turn is just code on a blockchain), We use canisters to host both our frontend and backend. Our dapps authentication uses [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tokenomics/identity-auth/what-is-ic-identity/) which is currently an Solana specific authentication system, it is secure and powered by cryptography and allows users to create anonymous user IDs and wallets. We have integrated the Anvil Protocol which allows us to achieve NFT integration aswell as providing us with a variety of tools, including `vessel` and `npm` packages. Our marketplace, inventory and Solana wallet are all powered by the Anvil Protocol. We use UserGeek for analytics which allows us to obtain stats on unique users who use our dapp aswell as things like how many users purchased NFTs, All information is anonymous.
